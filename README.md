Website for UMass Lowell's chapter of The Association for Computing Machinery

My chapter and I undertook the task of designing and developing a dynamic website to enhance the online presence and engagement of the chapter. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap framework, I created a visually appealing and user-friendly website that served as a central hub for information, resources, and community interaction.

- Collaborated closely with the UMass Lowell ACM Chapter team to understand their vision and goals for the website. Based on their requirements, I designed an intuitive and responsive layout, ensuring optimal user experience across different devices.

- Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I transformed the design into a fully functional website. I implemented a clean and organized code structure, adhering to best practices, semantic HTML markup, and efficient CSS styling. Bootstrap was utilized to expedite the development process and achieve a consistent and professional look.

- Integrated a user-friendly Content Management System into the website. This allowed them to add, modify, and delete content such as event details, announcements, and resources without any technical expertise.

- Incorporated interactive elements such as event calendars and registration forms. These features facilitated seamless event management and streamlined the process of capturing and managing attendees' information.
